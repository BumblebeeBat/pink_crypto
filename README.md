Pink Crypto

This is a collection of cryptographic tools that I use in my blockchains. Originally a part of the "Pink Fairy" blockchain.

It includes libraries for:

* doing math over bitcoin's elliptic curve.

* calculating a hash of erlang data structures.

* doing proof of work on erlang data structures.

* public/private cryptography.

* a library for making multisig addresses, and making multiparty signatures for those addresses.
